This is a repository for my demo application showcasing th euse of SwitUI and async/await. This application allows users to browse freely, view their browsing history, and view favorited photos and videos locally (records are saved of favorited items, however actual images and videos are not).



---

## Data Persistence 

This is done using a very basic implementation of SwiftData.

## Photo Interactions and Expansion

This is accomplished using a View Representable to wrap some UIKit implementations due to some limitations with existing SwiftUI features

## Third Party Code

No third party libraries were used in the development of this application, however I did reuse some code that I had from previous projects that I have found to scale really well in the production setting. Some examples include:
- NavigationPathContainer
- NewStack
- The extensions on View, UIApplication, and UIViewController

Lastly, credit is given to the code for acquiring thumbnails from remote videos and the App Icon is from Flaticon

Thank you for this opportunity.
